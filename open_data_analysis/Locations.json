This feature is one of the reasons why Nordheimer Ravine has been the focus of several ecological restoration projects.<br><br>\n\nRestoration efforts began in 1997 when ponds were created by the City of Toronto to collect water in some of the wetter sites within Nordheimer Ravine. Over the years volunteers have helped to plant trees, shrubs and many native terrestrial and aquatic herbaceous plants. Ongoing work by the City of Toronto, as well as volunteer stewards, has helped keep non-native invasive species at bay and allowed native species to flourish.

The design was completed by celebrated landscape architects Claude Cormier + Associ\u00c3\u00a9s of Montreal.

In 2002, a small marsh was added at the bottom of the slope to collect and clean storm water and provide habitat for native plants and animals. An eroded hillside path was replaced with a rock-lined trough that directs water to flow into the wetland area. Volunteers have helped to plant trees and shrubs in the marsh site, as well as native flowers, sedges, and rushes.

The residence was built for Colonel Harold C. Bickford, a decorated war hero. When Rosa Breithaupt Hewetson purchased the property in 1932, shortly before her marriage to Spencer Clark, the socially conscious couple decided to model their new property into the Canadian equivalent of Roycroft in East Aurora, New York, considered to be the centre of the Arts and Craft movement at the time. The site provided a home and a forum for artists and artisans, where their work was created and collected for the enjoyment of many. Many of the artists were contemporaries or students of members of the Group of Seven, and the influence can be seen in the work they produced.<br><br>\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Canadian Government requisitioned the property and turned it into a training base for the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENS). The hotel also served as a military hospital for victims of shellshock, with the craft facilities providing therapeutic rehabilitation for the service personnel undergoing treatment there.<br><br>\n\nThe Clarks returned to the property in 1947. For the next 35 years, the Clarks built a reputation as patrons of the arts and preservationists, amassing a huge art collection and preserving architectural fragments from dozens of demolished buildings. The property and the architectural fragments were sold to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in 1978 to be maintained as a public park. Spencer Clark continued to run the hotel until 1983, when a Board of Management was formed to oversee operations. At the time of the City's amalgamation, the Board was disbanded and the City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Economic Development and Culture Division took over responsibility for the sculpture and architectural fragments, while the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division began to manage the surrounding parkland. The hotel continued to operate under contract management until it closed in 2002 when it was considered no longer viable without a major capital infusion.<br><br>\n\nIt is the City of Toronto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vision that through a private/public partnership, the site can be redeveloped and the arts activity can once again flourish."}, {"_id": 345, "Location ID": 408, "Parent Location ID": 408, "Location Name": "St. James Park", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "King St E & Jarvis St", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Toronto and East York", "Street No": "120", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "King", "Street Type": "St", "Street Direction": "E", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "Located next to St. James Cathedral in downtown Toronto, this park is a series of formal gardens and are is beautiful place to stroll and relax.

When Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of Upper Canada's first Lieutenant-Governor, saw the beautifully carved sandstone cliffs in 1793, she considered building a summer residence on top and naming it Scarborough for the Yorkshire town of Scarborough, in England, that is also known for its cliffs. In the same year, Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe renamed the township Scarborough, as tribute to the Duke of York. When the township was originally surveyed in 1791 by Augustus Jones, it was called Glasgow. <br><br>\nIn 1920, the Scarborough Water Works System was constructed here. As Scarborough grew in population, the capacity of the filtration plant and pumping station were expanded; by 1952, the filtration plant processed 14.0 million gallons of water per day. Today, only the pumping station and the reservoir are still in use. <br><br>\nIn May 1960, the Borough of Scarborough transferred its Scarborough Bluff holdings to the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. Various parcels of land were combined as part of the Waterfront Plan, a program designed to promote public ownership along the bluffs as a means of curtailing further erosion."}, {"_id": 940, "Location ID": 1101, "Parent Location ID": 1101, "Location Name": "Silverbirch Boat House", "Location Type": "None", "Accessibility": "Partially Accessible", "Intersection": "Silver Birch Ave & Martin Goodman Trail", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Toronto and East York", "Street No": "2", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Silver Birch", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "None"}, {"_id": 941, "Location ID": 1102, "Parent Location ID": 1102, "Location Name": "St. Alban's Square", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Howland Ave & Barton Ave", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Toronto and East York", "Street No": "90", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Howland", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "None"}, {"_id": 942, "Location ID": 1103, "Parent Location ID": 1103, "Location Name": "Don Panos Parkette", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Prescott Ave & St Clair Ave W", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Toronto and East York", "Street No": "3", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Prescott", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "Formerly named St. Clair Gardens."}, {"_id": 943, "Location ID": 1104, "Parent Location ID": 1104, "Location Name": "St. Clements - Yonge Parkette", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "St Clements Ave & Yonge St", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "North York", "Street No": "14", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "St Clements", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "None"}, {"_id": 944, "Location ID": 1105, "Parent Location ID": 1105, "Location Name": "Stephen Leacock Community Recreation Centre", "Location Type": "crc", "Accessibility": "Fully Accessible", "Intersection": "None", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Scarborough", "Street No": "2500", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Birchmount", "Street Type": "Rd", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "M1T 2M5", "Description": "Stephen Leacock Community Recreation Centre has an indoor premier turf pad, dry pad, track and a new dance studio!

Bricks were forged using water from Mud Creek and clay from the Brick Works quarry. The bricks made at this site are used in buildings throughout Toronto, including Casa Loma, Massey Hall, the Ontario Legislature, parts of the University of Toronto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s St. George campus, and numerous private homes.<br><br>\n\nIn 1989 the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) acquired the Don Valley Brick Works site from private development, and in 1995 the City of Toronto and TRCA began restoration work. A series of wetland environments have been constructed to provide habitats for aquatic plants and wildlife, as well as to bring water from nearby Mud Creek through the wetland to be filtered naturally before it flows into the Don River, and ultimately Lake Ontario. With the help of dedicated volunteers and strong partnerships, the City of Toronto has successfully introduced wetland, dry wildflower meadow, and forest plant communities to different parts of the Don Valley Brick Works site, creating a variety of ecosystem types."}, {"_id": 1104, "Location ID": 1450, "Parent Location ID": 1450, "Location Name": "Crawford-Jones Memorial Park", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Dee Ave & Dee Cres", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Etobicoke York", "Street No": "80", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Dee", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "A 9.4 hectare park in the Humber River Valley near Highway 401 and Weston Road.

In Roman mythology, Sylvanus was a woodland deity and Sylvan refers to the wooded rural character of the area. An earlier name for the park was the Cherry Orchard. It was purchased from private owners in 1966 by Metropolitan Toronto, the regional government at the time. Later it was transferred to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. The land was acquired to curtail further erosion and to prevent possible development of housing on the site.<br><br>\nThe western boundary of Sylvan Park is close to Bellamy Creek where it cuts thorough the Scarbough Bluffs to Lake Ontario. The ravine surrounding Bellany Creek known as the Bellamy Ravine is also known as Gates Gully, after a well-known pioneer, Johnathan Gates who settled in the area in 1815. Gates later operated the Scarboro Inn, also known as Gates Tavern, on Kingston Road, just east of Bellamy Road.<br><br>\nMore recently, the trail through Gates Gulley was named after the well-known Canadian artist Doris McCarthy, who lived at the end of Meadowcliffe Road and owned a portion of the Bellamy Ravine. Doris McCarthy, best known for her landscape paintings, lived on the picturesque 12-acre property from 1939 to her death in 2010. She referred to her home as \"Fools Paradise\" and she donated it to the Ontario Heritage Trust in 1998, hoping that other artists would use the lands on the Scarborough Bluff to inspire art after her death. She donated the lands in the ravine to the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority for conservation and access purposes. A sculpture is located at the point where the Doris McCarthy Trail meets the lakeshore."}, {"_id": 1132, "Location ID": 1486, "Parent Location ID": 1486, "Location Name": "South Humber Park",

Stylized as H<sub>T</sub>O, the name is word play between the chemical element of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and the common abbreviation for Toronto, TO. \n<br><br>Billed as \"Toronto's Urban Beach\", H<sub>T</sub>O park is an inviting space that highlights contemporary landscape design.\n<br><br>\n<strong>Six Elements</strong><br> \nGround Planes - The site was reformed to create a tilted plane that acknowledges two aspects: the urban side and water side. At selected viewing points, a series of tilted planes break through the surface as places for sitting and gathering. Umbrella-dotted terraces step down to the lake. In addition, a pattern of linear surface planes running east-west across the parks abstractly recall the railway tracks that fed the now-defunct industries of the area.<br><br>\n\nWater - A series of connected water elements accentuate the theme of water returning to its source. Each element is programmed to celebrate the intrinsic qualities of water. These include motion activated sprays, steam and fog, variations in colour and coloured ice.<br><br>\n\nIslands - The overlay of green islands provide gently sloping lawns for repose. Islands that meet residential buildings become horticultural to mediate between the public and private. The islands in the slips mediate storm water overflow. Native water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge species act as an urban estuary to provide a living filter for micro-organisms.<br><br>\n\nExpressive Horticulture - The planting strategy involves three basic treatments: sloping lawns, horticultural and bio-remediation islands. Tree planting expresses a north-south gradient from a grove of multi-stem ash at the north, to wind-catching willows towards the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge. Planting of horticultural islands provide interest through the year, and buffer the residential or more private areas of the park. Selected species with winter berries contribute to the idea of the site as a bird and wildlife habitat.<br><br>\n\nLighting - Seasonal animation, a sense of identity, playfulness and security is created through the lighting. Tall mast lights act as an \u00e2\u0080\u0098area moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and is programmed to change seasonally. Lighting transforms the dark surfaces of the water basins. The water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge is softly illuminated by a connective glow. The lighting is also a vehicle for creating a sense of theatre and journey on the cultural corridors that line the city to the water.<br><br>\n\nBeach Furniture - The design calls for informal beach furniture scattered across the south end of the site, transforming it from an urban park to an urban beach.<br><br>\n<strong>History</strong><br>\nOver a decade ago, approximately 16 hectares (40 acres) of land within Toronto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harbourfront was designated for public parks, waters-edge promenade, and school/community centre users. Since that time, several of the park sites have been developed including the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>\n\nAt the end of June 2003, Toronto City Council approved a conceptual design for Phase I of the Harbourfront Parks and Open Space System. Phase I was to focus on Maple Leaf Quay East, Maple Leaf Quay West, and their related slips.

The park design is inspired by Bach's First Suite for Unaccompanied Cello, with each dance movement within the suite corresponding to a different section of the garden. <br><br>\nPublic art honouring Terry Fox was installed in the park in October 2023. <br><br>\n\n<strong>Gardens &amp; Plant List - Bach's Suite No. 1 for Unaccompanied Cello</strong><br>\n\nPrelude - An undulating riverscape with curves &amp; bends: The first moment of the suite imparts the feeling of a flowing river through which the visitor can stroll. Granite boulders from the southern edge of the Canadian Shield are placed to represent a stream bed with low-growing plants softening its banks. The whole is overtopped by an alley of native Hackberry trees, whose straight trunks and regular spacing suggest measures of music.<br><br>\n\nAllemande - A forest grove of wandering trails: The Allemande is an ancient German dance. Interpreted here as a Birch forest, the movement invites the visitor to swirl inward to various contemplative sitting areas, that move higher and higher up the hillside, culminating in a rocky vantage point that looks over the harbour through a circle of Dawn Redwood trees.<br><br>\n\nCourante - A swirling path through a wildflower meadow: Originally an Italian and French dance form, the Courante is an exuberant movement that is interpreted here as a huge, upward-spiralling swirl through a lush field of grasses and brightly-coloured perennials that attract birds and butterflies. At the top, a Maypole spins in the wind.<br><br>\n\nSarabande - A Conifer grove in the shape of an arc: This movement is based on an ancient Spanish dance form. Its contemplative quality is interpreted here as an inward-arcing circle that is enclosed by tall needle-leaf evergreen trees. Envisioned as a poet's corner, the garden's centerpiece is a huge stone that acts as a stage for readings, and holds a small pool with water that reflects the sky.<br><br>\n\nMenuett - A formal flower parterre: This French dance was contemporary to Bach's time. Its formality and grace are reflected in the symmetry and geometry of this movement's design. Hand-crafted with ornamental steel, a circular pavilion is designed to shelter small musical ensembles or dance groups.<br><br>\n\nGigue - Giant grass steps that dance you down to the outside world: The Gigue, or \"jog\" is an English dance, whose jaunty, rollicking music is interpreted here as a series of giant grass steps that offer views onto the harbour. The steps form a curved amphitheatre that focus on a stone stage set under a weeping willow tree; a place for informal performances. Shrubs and perennials act as large, enclosing arms, framing views out onto the harbour.<br><br>\n\n<strong>History</strong><br>\n\nInspired by Bach - Inspired by the pictorial element in Johann Sebastian Bach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, internationally renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma collaborated with a number of artists to produce Inspired by Bach \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a six part film series. The series was produced by Rhombus Media Incorporated and broadcasted in 1997 and 1998.<br><br>\n\nFor the first film in the series, The Music Garden, Mr. Ma worked with landscape designer Julie Moir Messervy to interpret in nature the music of Bach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first suite. As a result of the film project, Yo-Yo Ma, Julie Messervy and Rhombus Media Incorporated approached the city of Boston, Massachusetts to create an actual garden based on The Music Garden. When the Boston site fell through, Toronto enthusiastically embraced the project.<br><br>\n\nThe Design - Julie Messervy designed the waterfront Music Garden in collaboration with landscape architects from the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Parks, Forestry and Recreation Department. The garden design interprets in nature Bach\u00e2\u0080\u0099s First Suite for Unaccompanied Cello, with each dance movement within the suite corresponding to a different section in the garden. Two Canadian artists created special features for the Music Garden. Tom Tollefson, architectural blacksmith, fabricated the Music Pavilion, and the late Anne Roberts of Feir Mill Desing Inc., designed the Maypole.<br><br>\n\nThe Donors - James Douglas Fleck led the private side of a public/private collaboration with the City of Toronto to create and build the Toronto Music Garden. The donors are David and Vivian Campbell, George and Kathy Dembroski, James and Margaret Fleck, David and Catherine Graham, Michael and Sonja Koerner, Wilmot and Judy Matthews, Jim and Sandra Pitblado and Sandra Simpson.

HBBH is approximately four acres and includes the following:<br><br>\n\nShort Grass Prairie - The short grass prairie component of the HBBH is located along the stormwater management pond at the west-end of the site. The low growing, drought tolerant vegetation characteristic of this native plant community, provides a variety of host and nectar plants for caterpillars and butterflies. Trees and shrubs have been planted on the berm opposite the prairie, to offer perching areas, shelter and further food sources.<br><br>\n\nWildflower Meadow - The Wildflower Meadow represents the largest component of the HBBH, and lies at the furthest east-end of the habitat. There are four vegetation communities represented in this meadow: tallgrass prairie, shortgrass prairie, wet meadow and upland meadow. Each area provides a distinct mix of native wildflowers, grasses and sedges as well as unique physical features. The area between the wildflower meadow and the lake is a large native shrub and tree bed, which provides food, shelter and a wind break for the meadow.<br><br>\n\nHome Garden - Have you ever wondered how you can turn your garden into a haven for butterflies? The Home Garden incorporates butterfly-friendly plants and physical features that lend themselves to a backyard setting. Key features include benches, stonewalls, gravel and interlocking walkways, perennial beds with native and ornamental species, and interpretive art features."}, {"_id": 1257, "Location ID": 2056, "Parent Location ID": 2056, "Location Name": "Lake Crescent Park", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Lake Crescent and Royal York Road", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Etobicoke York", "Street No": "55", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Lake", "Street Type": "Cres", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "In 2021, the playground was improved as part of the <a href=\"https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/planning-development/construction-new-facilities/playground-enhancement-program/\">Playground Enhancement Program</a> and features climbing equipment, swings with an inclusive seat and accessible pathways."}, {"_id": 1258, "Location ID": 2057, "Parent Location ID": 2057, "Location Name": "Long Branch Park & Cenotaph", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Long Branch Ave & Park Blvd", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Etobicoke York", "Street No": "23", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Long Branch", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "None"}, {"_id": 1259, "Location ID": 2058, "Parent Location ID": 2058, "Location Name": "Maurice J.

The urban beach is the focal point of HTO Park West. Bright yellow umbrellas populate the white sand providing shade for those relaxing in muskoka chairs. Take in the scenery or have a picnic. It's a great spot to enjoy while exploring Toronto's engaging waterfront. <br><br>\nStylized as H<sub>T</sub>O, the name is word play between the chemical element of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and the common abbreviation for Toronto, TO.<br><br>\n\n<strong>Six Elements</strong><br> \nGround Planes - The site was reformed to create a tilted plane that acknowledges two aspects: the urban side and water side. At selected viewing points, a series of tilted planes break through the surface as places for sitting and gathering. Umbrella-dotted terraces step down to the lake. In addition, a pattern of linear surface planes running east-west across the parks abstractly recall the railway tracks that fed the now-defunct industries of the area.<br><br>\n\nWater - A series of connected water elements accentuate the theme of water returning to its source. Each element is programmed to celebrate the intrinsic qualities of water. These include motion activated sprays, steam and fog, variations in colour and coloured ice.<br><br>\n\nIslands - The overlay of green islands provide gently sloping lawns for repose. Islands that meet residential buildings become horticultural to mediate between the public and private. The islands in the slips mediate storm water overflow. Native water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge species act as an urban estuary to provide a living filter for micro-organisms.<br><br>\n\nExpressive Horticulture - The planting strategy involves three basic treatments: sloping lawns, horticultural and bio-remediation islands. Tree planting expresses a north-south gradient from a grove of multi-stem ash at the north, to wind-catching willows towards the water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge. Planting of horticultural islands provide interest through the year, and buffer the residential or more private areas of the park. Selected species with winter berries contribute to the idea of the site as a bird and wildlife habitat.<br><br>\n\nLighting - Seasonal animation, a sense of identity, playfulness and security is created through the lighting. Tall mast lights act as an \u00e2\u0080\u0098area moon\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and is programmed to change seasonally. Lighting transforms the dark surfaces of the water basins. The water\u00e2\u0080\u0099s edge is softly illuminated by a connective glow. The lighting is also a vehicle for creating a sense of theatre and journey on the cultural corridors that line the city to the water.<br><br>\n\nBeach Furniture - The design calls for informal beach furniture scattered across the south end of the site, transforming it from an urban park to an urban beach.<br><br>\n<strong>History</strong><br>\nOver a decade ago, approximately 16 hectares (40 acres) of land within Toronto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Harbourfront was designated for public parks, waters-edge promenade, and school/community centre users. Since that time, several of the park sites have been developed including the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>\n\nAt the end of June 2003, Toronto City Council approved a conceptual design for Phase I of the Harbourfront Parks and Open Space System. Phase I was to focus on Maple Leaf Quay East, Maple Leaf Quay West, and their related slips. They were planned to essentially connect Harbourfront Centre with the Spadina Quay Wetland and the Toronto Music Garden.<br><br>\n\nIn July 2004, Mayor David Miller and Deputy Mayor Joe Pantalone, Chair, Harbourfront Parks Steering Committee unveiled the new location for a waterfront park, H<sub>T</sub>O.<br><br>\n\nThe winning design team for Phase I consisted of Janet Rosenberg & Associates Landscapes Architects of Toronto and Claude Cormier Architects Paysagistes Inc. of Montreal. Together they created the design known as H<sub>T</sub>O.

In 1995 the Toronto Region and Conservation Authority (TRCA) designated Crothers Woods an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) due to its relatively undisturbed woodland habitat, and the area was adopted as an ESA in Toronto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Official Plan in 2015. This area is home to many mature trees, including some that are over a century old, as well as some plant and animal species that are rare in the Toronto area.<br><br>\n\nWhile Crothers Woods has a healthy canopy, much of the understory was lost due to past unmanaged recreational uses. The popularity of the site for recreational use poses a risk of further habitat disturbance. Environmental impacts of public use of this natural area were addressed by the City of Toronto through the Crothers Woods Trail Management Strategy. The Strategy outlines ways to restore and protect the area in order to maintain existing natural heritage features, create safe, logical, and sensitive trail systems, and improve park user safety. The City of Toronto has worked with volunteers to control invasive species, maintain trails and encourage trail users to enjoy the area responsibly."}, {"_id": 1889, "Location ID": 3594, "Parent Location ID": 3594, "Location Name": "Santa Chiara Parkette - Anne Marie D'Amico Square", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "St Claire Ave W & Northcliffe Blvd", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Etobicoke York", "Street No": "1114", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "St Clair Ave W", "Street Type": "Ave", "Street Direction": "W", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "None"}, {"_id": 1890, "Location ID": 3595, "Parent Location ID": 3595, "Location Name": "Northern Secondary School", "Location Type": "school", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Mt Pleasant Rd & Roehampton Ave", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Toronto and East York", "Street No": "851", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Mt Pleasant", "Street Type": "Rd", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "None"}, {"_id": 1891, "Location ID": 3596, "Parent Location ID": 3596, "Location Name": "Glen Stewart Ravine", "Location Type": "park", "Accessibility": "None", "Intersection": "Glen Manor Dr & Glen Stewart Ave", "TTC Information": "None", "District": "Toronto and East York", "Street No": "351", "Street No Suffix": "None", "Street Name": "Glen Manor", "Street Type": "Dr", "Street Direction": "None", "Postal Code": "None", "Description": "Glen Stewart is an 11 hectare ravine with a wide diversity of plant and bird life.
